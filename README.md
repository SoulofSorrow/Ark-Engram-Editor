**Ark Engram Editor**

This Python program provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for managing engram entries in a text-based configuration file. The tool is created using the tkinter module and allows you to add, edit, delete, load, and save engram entries.

## Features

- **Add Entries**: Add new engram entries by entering the required information, including engram name, cost, level requirements, and more.

- **Edit Entries**: Modify existing entries by selecting them and changing the values in the input fields.

- **Delete Entries**: Remove unwanted engram entries from the list.

- **Load Data**: Load engram data from an external configuration file by selecting the file.

- **Save Data**: Save the current engram entries to a file.

## Usage

1. Ensure that Python is installed on your computer. The Tkinter module is included with standard Python distributions, so no additional packages are required.

2. Open a command prompt or terminal window and navigate to the directory where the program is located.

3. Use the command `python start.py` to run the program.

4. The program will start and display a graphical user interface where you can manage engram entries.

## Notes

- You can add new engram entries by entering the required information into the input fields and clicking the "Add" button.

- Edit existing entries by selecting them in the table and clicking the "Edit" button.

- Delete entries by selecting them in the table and clicking the "Delete" button.

- Use the "Load Data" and "Load Engram Entries" buttons to import data from external files.

- Save the current engram entries to a file by clicking the "Save Data" button.

This tool provides an easy way to organize and manage engram entries for games or applications that use text-based configuration files. It is particularly useful when you need to manage many entries and prefer a user-friendly interface.
